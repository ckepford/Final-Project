                    My roots are in the south but my heart is in California. Some of the great things about the south are the people,
                    their hospitality and friendliness and of course the food and sweet tea.
                    California’s beauty to me is the diversity of people, cultures and landscapes and especially the coast.
                    My soul is at peace and most alive when I’m at the beach.
                </p>

                    Faith and family are most important to me. I’ve been fortunate to be able to focus on being a mom to my littles during their early years and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm convinced that being a mom is the hardest, but most fullfilling job. EVER. During that time I have had so much fun dabbling in all sorts of crafty goodness such as painting, sewing, photography, gardening etc. A few things I'm always up for are yummy coffee, thrifting and a good game of ping pong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My desire to travel and explore and also give to others more has lead me to decide its
                    time to learn a new skill that will enable my family and I to live out our dreams.
                    This has led me to Geekwise Academy to further my education and become equpped with
                    skills and resources needed to pursue a career in the tech world. I'm excited about the opportunites
                    that lie ahead!
